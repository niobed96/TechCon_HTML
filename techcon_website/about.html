                <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon, one of the most renowned technology conferences today, had humble beginnings. 
                It was created to serve as a platform where technology enthusiasts, developers, and leaders could come together 
                to share ideas, collaborate, and innovate for a brighter technological future.

                <h3>The Inception - 2005</h3>
                <p>
                    TechCon was founded in 2005 by a small group of technology professionals who recognized 
                    the need for a collaborative space to discuss emerging trends in technology. 
                    The first event was held in a modest community center with fewer than 150 attendees. 
                    Despite its small scale, the conference ignited a passion for innovation and created 
                    a close-knit network of like-minded individuals.
